- **Do not use external CSS frameworks**; keep styles within MUI or minimal in `index.css`.
- **Use Framer Motion** for animations where needed.
- **Write clear, concise commit messages.**
- **Lint your code** before pushing.
- **Open a pull request** for all changes. Describe your changes clearly.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
- For issues with Vite, refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
